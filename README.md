##What is Skippable?
---
>There's a lot of TV to watch out there...  
And sometimes we just don't have the time to watch it all ...
All of Star Trek adds up 22 days of ***NONSTOP*** watching
There has to be a better way to do it!  

###[Queue SKiPpaBLe.TV]
 The solution to your binge watching needs
## What it does
* Track shows you're watching
* Recommend TV shows to watch based on what you're watching**
* Bar based representation of what episodes you should and shouldn't watch based on IMDB reviews and ratings and Wikipedia
* Web and OS interface
 * No app on appstores ... _yet_
* Written in Java to allow cross-platform support
* Securely stored data
* Rate shows and episodes once you've completed watching them
* Friendly, easy to use control panel / interface  
 

## How it Works
* User chooses what show they want to binge watch
* User adjusts slider to specify how fast they want to watch a season
* A queue of recommended episodes is compiled that meets the user's time specifications
* Friendly interface makes it easy to look back on your binges
 * Progress bars show how far the user has gone through the season and how long until they finish the season
 * Sliders allow user to set how much they want to watch / skip of a particular season
 * An episode queue is generated based on community and IMDB ratings

### Episode Ratings
* User contributes descriptions, plot summaries and ratings for viewed episodes
 * Wikipedia and IMDB are primers for content
* Collectively, all users determine the relative value of each episode and the degree to which it's considered "essential viewing"


## Users
* Three types of users
 * User (Can create a personal list of favorite shows to be watched. Can create, edit and rate shows
 * Moderator (Imposes editing restrictions on shows / episodes. Basically blocks internet trolls)
 * Administrator (Controlls who is and isn't a moderator)  

## Layout
* User connects to service using client / web application
* Server receives and processes client requests to store and retrieve data
* Data goes through encryption and decryption through each stage to ensure security
* All data is stored in a secure database

That's all we have for now! Let the binge watching begin!
